# QA Automation Framework for dApp Testing

## Overview

This repository contains an automated test suite for a decentralized application from Libre Capital QA Challenge using **Dappwright**, **Playwright**, and **Cucumber.js**. The tests cover wallet connections, ERC20 token interactions, and deposits on the Sepolia testnet.

## Features

- **Cucumber BDD Tests** – Step definitions using Gherkin syntax
- **Dappwright Integration** – Automated MetaMask interactions
- **Playwright for Browser Automation**
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline** – Automated test execution
- **dApp Interaction** – ERC20 token search, deposits, and wallet management
